# SeaWorld Plastic Collector
Plastic Collector is a 2D game developed in Processing as part of my first-year Computer Science project. With an environmental sustainability theme, the game challenges players to clean up the ocean by collecting plastic while avoiding marine life. The project was a great opportunity to apply fundamental programming concepts, including object movement, collision detection, and user interaction, while also emphasizing an important real-world issue.

Players control a scuba diver using arrow keys, navigating the underwater environment to collect floating plastic debris. Every collected plastic increases the score, but colliding with fish decreases it. Oxygen levels act as a time limit, adding urgency to the game. If the oxygen runs out or the player's score drops too low due to fish collisions, the game ends with a dynamic summary reflecting their performance.

This project showcases my ability to design and implement interactive experiences, handle real-time game mechanics, and manage UI feedback. It also highlights my problem-solving skills in balancing challenge and engagement within a simple yet meaningful game. Developing Plastic Collector allowed me to gain hands-on experience in game logic, event handling, and structured programming, making it a strong foundational project in my portfolio.
